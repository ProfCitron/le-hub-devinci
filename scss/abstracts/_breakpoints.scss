/*
IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

1. Inverted media queries

Student intranet was build in 2010's.
This isn't a mobile-first website. That's why we decided to use max-width media query based instead of min-width


2. Breakpoints choices

Student intranet works with boostrap 2, we'll use the same breakpoints.
As it's an old version of bootstrap, I decided to add a custom breakpoint mixin for nowadays usages
